This folder contains input files for the model

9679UniqueReads.csv = filtered raw unique mapped reads 
  each Column name = Cross_Treatment_Replicate_Read
    Cross: Parents = SD and SCN (SC in the manuscript) F1 hybrid = SCfxSDm and SDfxSCm
    Treatment: 20 = control, 35 = heat stress
    Replicate: 2015 = replicate#1, 2016 = replicate#2 (each biological replicate was made independently on that year)
    Read: number of reads mapped to SD or SC allele
    
9679ContigName.csv = file contain matching reference contig names and gene names from blast
  The gene number in the input file is corresponding with the contig names in the 9679ContigNames.csv file
